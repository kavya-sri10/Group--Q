🏥 AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant

Smart Symptom Analysis → Specialist Recommendation → Instant Appointment Booking

In today’s healthcare system, patients often face confusion and delays before receiving proper medical attention. The problem is not a lack of doctors — it’s a lack of clarity, accessibility, and intelligent guidance during the first stage of seeking care. People usually don’t know which specialist to consult, where to find them, or how to book appointments efficiently.
